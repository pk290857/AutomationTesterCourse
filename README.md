portfolio

this repo covers the final project of my course on automation testing at Coders Lab; 
it consisted in two exercises in which various functionalities were tested; 

first, "workshopProblem1", concerned an online shop website; 
we tested sign-in, new address creation (required fields only), the new address deletion;

second, "workshopProblem2", concerned the same website; 
we tested adding given noumber of a given product to the cart and purchase checkout; 

in addition, the folder "workshopProblem1POP" contains (very preliminar) implementetion of the first problem
within the Page Object Pattern (POP) methodology.
